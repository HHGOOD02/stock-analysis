# Stock Analysis Project

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the best structural methodology when examining and forming conclusions based off of historic stock data. By first creating an analytical model to build a picture of the total volume traded, as well as the Yearly return of each stock in both 2017 and 2018, it is possible to gain a high level picture of which stocks are performing best, which can then be used to drive buy/sell decisions.

## Analysis
We did no analysis, we just compiled descriptive traits of the data. 


## Conclusions
There is no conclusion to make. Only descriptive trends that may or may not continue into the future. We have learned nothing about the potential future performance of these stocks, and purchasing decisions that are made upon this data are being done on the basis of faulty reasoning.
